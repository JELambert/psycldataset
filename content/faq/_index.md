To calculate the at-a-distance psychological values speech data is collected for each leader in the data set.  This speech data can be either prepared (meaning a leader has prepared remarks for a given speech), or it can be spontaneous (meaning a leader is responding to questions or comments in a spontaneous fashion).

Once speeches are identified, collected, and properly annotated to ensure validity, they are then processed using Social Science Automation's **[Profiler Plus](http://socialscience.net/tech/ProfilerPlus.aspx)**. For valid estimates of psychological traits, any word count under 4000 is unreliable.

Text-based calculations for the raw totals and specific variable information are as follows:
# Leadership Trait Analysis
Leadership trait analysis is a method for assessing a variety of personality traits. This method has been developed largely by Hermann (1980).

## Distrust
This variable is concerned with a leader's feeling towards others.  Scores higher in this category indicate a heightened suspicion of others.  Motives and actions of others are perceived with skepticism and concern.
<br>
<br>

## Task
This variable represents the leader's focus on either group cohesion (low scores), or task completion (high scores).  Scores in the middle range represent a balanced approach at both of these goals.
<br>
<br>

## Belief in Ability to Control Events
This variable represents the leader's belief they are personally capable of controlling the situation being discussed. Scores high on this scale indicate an increased belief in their own ability.
<br>
<br>

## In Group Bias
This variable represent the degree of bias towards their own group a leader maintains. Higher scores in this variable indicate a greater attachment to a particular leader's group.
<br>

## Self Confidence
This variable represents a leader's sense of self. Those with higher levels of self-importance will score higher on this scale.
<br>
<br>

## Conceptual Complexity
This variable represents the degree to which a leader contextualizes the world in either absolute or relative terms.  Leaders who score higher in conceptual complexity view the world in shades of gray.
<br>
<br>

## Need for Power
This variable represents the leader's personal need for authority. Leaders who score higher on this scale are more likely attempting to control situations or people.

# Operational Code
Operational code is based off of ten fundamental questions posed by George (1969). These have been adapted by Holsti (1977) and Walker (1983).  More recently they have been made computationally derivable using the _Verbs in Context System_ (Walker, Schafer, Young 1998).

## I-1
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in what is the best means to achieve a goal. Lower scores indicate conflict is the preferred strategy, and high scores indicate favor towards cooperation.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I1.png">}}

## I-2
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in how intensely tactics to achieve a goal should be. Higher scores would indicate cooperation, and lower scores indicate conflictual tactic intensity.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I2.png">}}

## I-3
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in risks associated with political action. Low scores indicate a leader who is risk averse, versus high scores which suggest an increased risk acceptance
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I3.png">}}

## I-4a
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in the flexibility of tactics, specifically between cooperation and conflict. Higher scores indicate a flexible approach and low scores indicate inflexibility.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I4a.png">}}

## I-4b
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in the flexibility of tactics, specifically between words and deeds. Higher scores indicate a flexible approach and low scores indicate inflexibility.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I4b.png">}}

## I-5ap
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in the utility of the approach appeal or support.  Higher scores indicate the leader views this approach has utility, and low scores indicate they do not.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I5ap.png">}}

## I-5pr
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in the utility of the approach promise.  Higher scores indicate the leader views this approach has utility, and low scores indicate they do not.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I5pr.png">}}

## I-5re
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in the utility of the approach reward.  Higher scores indicate the leader views this approach has utility, and low scores indicate they do not.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I5re.png">}}

## I-5op
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in the utility of the approach oppose or resist.  Higher scores indicate the leader views this approach has utility, and low scores indicate they do not.
<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I5op.png">}}

## I-5th
This variable measures a leader's instrumental belief in the utility of the approach threaten.  Higher scores indicate the leader views this approach has utility, and low scores indicate they do not.

<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I5th.png">}}

## I-5pu

<br>
<br>
{{< figure  src="https://github.com/JELambert/Psych_Agg/raw/master/data/images/I5pu.png">}}

## P-1
This variable measures a leader's philosophical belief in the fundamental nature of the political universe. Higher scores indicate that a leader views the world in friendly terms, and lower scores indicate a hostile universe.
